昨天有人问我，他的 ChatGPT 账号被封了，问我怎么恢复。我的 ChatGPT 账号在去年 10 月份也被封禁了，发了几个申诉邮件后，账号恢复了。不过前后拉扯了一个半月，这里记录下之前申诉的邮件内容，希望能帮到遇到问题的人，不保证完全有效，但是可以试试。

## 第一步先止损
我的账号是用 APP Store 付费的 ChatGPT Plus，所以第一步就是去苹果网站申请退款。具体操作可以参考苹果官网的说明：[针对从 Apple 购买的 App 或内容请求退款](https://support.apple.com/zh-cn/118223)，网站：https://support.apple.com/zh-cn/118223

一般隔几天就能收到退款了。

如果是虚拟卡支付的，看能不能先锁卡，防止后续账号没有申诉回来，虚拟卡的钱继续被扣费。

## 发邮件申诉
用自己的账号邮箱发邮件给 OpenAI：support@openai.com

申诉邮件内容如下 **记得把大括号里面的内容替换成自己的用户名**，或者换成自己的账号邮箱：

```
Dear Support Team at ChatGPT,

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I am reaching out under the name {用户名}, to formally request the reactivation of my ChatGPT account, under the username {用户名}. It has come to my attention that my account has been suspended, presumably due to abnormal activities that I believe were caused by unauthorized use and access by an unknown party.

It was recently brought to my attention that my account security was compromised. I am led to believe that an individual unauthorized by me had accessed and improperly utilized my account. I wish to express my sincerest apologies for any disturbance or inconvenience this situation may have precipitated within the ChatGPT user community. Please be assured, I had no involvement in the conduct that precipitated the suspension of my account.

In an effort to rectify this situation and regain access to my account, I have updated my password and activated two-factor authentication to bolster the security of my account. I respectfully request that you conduct a thorough examination of my case to corroborate my assertions and contemplate the reinstatement of my account.

I hold the principles and guidelines of the ChatGPT community in high regard and have always endeavored to contribute positively and constructively. I recognize the significance of ensuring a secure and pleasant platform for all users and deeply regret any disturbances this incident may have caused.

Should you require any further details or actions on my part to aid in your investigation and the resolution of this matter, please do not hesitate to inform me. I am fully prepared to assist with any additional verifications or inquiries.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and am hopeful for a swift resolution. I look forward to your prompt response and am hopeful for the possibility of regaining access to my account at the earliest convenience.

Warmest regards.
```


我这里发完立马收到了一封机器人的回复，大致意思是说我的账号被封了，然后问我怎么使用 ChatGPT 的。

## 发第二封邮件

我们再发一封邮件，大意就是说我的账号是正常使用的，没有违反任何规则，一直遵守 ChatGPT 的规则和政策。邮件内容如下：

## 账号恢复
又过了 15 天，11 月 15 号的时候，收到了回复，说我的账号恢复了。但是我登录到账号的时候，可以登录，但是发现无法聊天，提示还是异常，然后又发了一封邮件说账号没有完全恢复。

不过发完邮件我记得等了两三天就可以用了。


## 但是
最后收到邮件是在 12 月 3 号，OpenAI 回复说: 经过彻底审查，还是决定停用我的账号！

WTF?

太离谱了，不过我的账号确实一直能用到现在，也没什么影响。不确定后面会不会还会停用。
